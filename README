OCR::Naive - convert images into text in a extremely naive fashion
==================================================================

The module implements a very simple and unsophisticated OCR by finding all
known images in a larger image. The known images are mapped to text using the
preexisting dictionary, and the text lines are returned.

The interesting stuff here is the image finding itself - it is done by a
regexp! For all practical reasons, images can be easily treated as byte
strings, and regexps are not exception. For example, one needs to locate an
image 2x2 in larger 7x7 image. The regexp constructed should be the first
scanline of smaller image, 2 bytes, verbatim, then 7 - 2 = 5 of any character,
and finally the second scanline, 2 bytes again. Of course there are some
quirks, but these explained in API section.

Dictionaries for different fonts can be created interactively by
"bin/makedict"; the non-interactive recognition is performed by "bin/ocr" which
is a mere wrapper to this module.

Prerequisites

Prima
IPA

Installation
============

perl Makefile.PL

sudo make install

Examples
========

perl -Iblib/lib bin/makedict -v --dict=examples/dict examples/vim.png

   Run this and see how makedict tries to detect glyphs. Note that it 
   the first glyph it fails to detect is inverted ('semicolon').


perl -Iblib/lib bin/ocr -v --dict=examples/dict examples/xterm.png

   some text must come outt
